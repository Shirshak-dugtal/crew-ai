These models can integrate clinical, genomic, imaging and histopathological information to simulate organ behaviour and disease progress as well as predict responses to treatments. The concept of digital twins has shown potential in various fields, but its application in uro-oncology is still evolving, with few assessments of their feasibility and clinical utility. The advent of artificial intelligence adds a new dimension to their development, potentially enabling the synthesis of diverse, high-quality datasets to improve modelling accuracy and support real-time decision-making. However, substantial challenges exist, including data integration, patient privacy, computational demands and ethical frameworks. In addition, the interpretability of predictions remains essential for gaining clinical trust and guiding patient-centred decisions. The use of digital twins in uro-oncology has the potential to improve patient stratification and treatment planning; however, barriers must be overcome for their successful implementation in clinical routine.

Inflammatory and nutritional indices were investigated with several variables, including neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI), and Glasgow prognostic score. TROP2 was highly expressed in 46 (41.8%) patients, and its overexpression was significantly associated with poor response to Nivo-Ipi therapy. Univariate analysis of all patients identified performance status, liver metastases, bone metastases, NLR, TROP2, PLR, SII, PNI, and ALI as significant predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after Nivo-Ipi treatment. Multivariate analysis identified TROP2 overexpression as an independent prognostic predictor for PFS and OS.

In this study, we propose the Laplacian filter attention with style transfer generative adversarial network (LASTGAN) to solve the problem of missing sequences in brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our method combines image imputation and image-to-image translation to accurately synthesize specific sequences of missing MR images. LASTGAN can accurately synthesize both overall anatomical structures and tumor regions of the brain in MR images by employing a novel attention module that utilizes a Laplacian filter. Additionally, among the other sub-networks, the generator injects a style vector of the missing domain that is subsequently inferred by the style encoder, while the style mapper assists the generator in synthesizing domain-specific images. We show that the proposed model, LASTGAN, synthesizes high quality MR images with respect to other existing GAN-based methods.

In aged mice, progressing tumors recruit DP8 cells via the CXCL16–CXCR6 axis to suppress antitumor CD4 + T cells in an ADP/adenosine-dependent manner, and targeting DP8 cell function or recruitment can reverse tumor growth in aged mice. This tumor-promoting mechanism of DP8 cells appears to be conserved in older humans, as we detected DP8-like cells in various tumors, including late-onset breast cancer.

The goal is to develop bispecific antibodies that engage natural killer (NK) cells with tumor targets. It's the latest sign of a surging interest in NK cell–based cancer immunotherapies, which last July saw NK cell company Conkwest (now NantKwest) in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California, haul in $260 million in its initial public offering (IPO). A clutch of companies and institutions pushing for the next big thing in oncology is moving forward with NK cell–based immunotherapy ( Table 1 ). Forty years after their discovery, NK cells “have come of age,” says Michael Caligiuri, director of the Ohio State University comprehensive cancer center in Columbus, Ohio. Much of the enthusiasm is spillover from the success of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, which have transformed the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer. But NK cells belong to the innate immune system—the rough-and-ready arm of the immune response—and their peculiarities as cytotoxic lymphocytes offer certain advantages that drug developers are keen to exploit.

However, the precise mechanisms controlling the accumulation of β-catenin protein in CRC cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that TRIM24 is elevated in CRC tissues and partially distributed in the cytoplasm. TRIM24 is phosphorylated at serine 1042 by Aurora kinase B (AURKB), which promotes its cytoplasmic distribution. Subsequently, TRIM24 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by facilitating AKT activation through interaction with and ubiquitination of its negative regulator von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), resulting in β-catenin accumulation and enhanced proliferation of CRC cells. Moreover, chemical inhibition of AURKB suppresses tumor growth in subcutaneous mouse model and exhibits particular effectiveness against tumors derived from CRC cells characterized by prominent cytoplasmic TRIM24 distribution. Together, these findings reveal a critical role of TRIM24 in CRC cell proliferation, particularly through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling."}, {"id": 40, "title": "Post-resection delivery of a TLR7/8 agonist from a biodegradable scaffold achieves immune-mediated glioblastoma clearance and protection against tumor challenge in mice - Nature Communications", "abstract": "Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer with a dismal prognosis despite current therapeutic interventions. Surgical tumor resection, standard-of-care for glioblastoma, not only results in the reduction of tumor burden, but also has profound immunostimulatory effects, offering a unique opportunity to break local immune tolerance and mount an effective anti-tumor immune response. Here, we explore the effect of local controlled release of resiquimod, a TLR7/8 agonist, from a biodegradable polymer scaffold implanted at the time of tumor resection. We find that treatment leads to the clearance of residual post-resection tumor, improved survival, and subsequent protection from tumor challenges in orthotopic mouse models of glioma. In addition, the controlled release of resiquimod from the scaffold boosts the resection-mediated disruption to the tumor microenvironment, leading to an early inflammatory innate immune response both in the brain and cervical lymph node, followed by an influx of lymphocytes. Thus, we show that sustained local TLR7/8 agonism at the time of tumor resection represents a promising approach for the treatment of glioblastoma."}, {"id": 41, "title": "Wearable device-based health equivalence of different physical activity intensities against mortality, cardiometabolic disease, and cancer - Nature Communications", "abstract": "Current conventions, partly derived from self-reported data, typically equate 1 minute of vigorous physical activity (VPA) to 2 minutes of moderate physical activity (MPA).

Results A cohort of 1671 patients was considered for allocation to a phase I study, of whom 518 patients were recruited to a phase I study and 1153 patients were not. A multivariable analysis revealed polypharmacy was associated with lower recruitment to phase I trials with an odds ratio of 0.95 (95% CI: [0.92, 0.99], p = 0.01), and a greater number of emergency admissions with a risk ratio of 1.1 (95% CI: [1.03, 1.17], p = 0.01).

We discuss the idea that the central engine for generating immunoresistant tumor cell variants is the genomic instability and dysregulation that is characteristic of the transformed genome. “Natural selection” of heterogeneous tumor cells results in the survival and proliferation of variants that happen to possess genetic and epigenetic traits that facilitate their growth and immune evasion.

Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000×), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10 , CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking.

Available data on intravenous and oral SACT enabled the calculation of the proportion of patients who received SACT each of the 360 days before death. Results A total of 8953 patients were eligible for this study. At day 30, 7, and 1 before death, 8.9%, 1.3%, and 0.4% respectively, received SACT. The reduction was mainly caused by reduced use of chemotherapy and immunotherapy closer to death. Independent predictors for receiving SACT at day 30 before death were young age, male sex, small-cell lung cancer, short time from diagnosis to death, and good performance status. Conclusion The presented low use of SACT at EOL has been achieved in a population where good survival has been documented.

Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1."}]
